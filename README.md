# CAplastics
exploring patterns in CA's plastics data from cleanup efforts

## Project workflow
I have the scripts in a .Rproj, with subfolders 'data' and 'figures' where each is
respectively kept. I use here() to access these folders & save in them. 


## Notes about the Coastal Cleanup Day data & visualizations
The data is stored in the 'data' folder as "Coastalcleanupday_data.xlsx". 
The visualizations for these data are in ccd.R, which is unfortunately messy but it
gets the job done.
